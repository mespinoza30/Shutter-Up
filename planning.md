# Shutter-up!
Where photographers share their images.

## Motivation
What motivated me to make this app was that there are a lot of platforms for people to share pictures that they take, but very few where photographers, from all expertise levels, can share their images. Additionally, this will allow photographers to share feedback or give advice on how to better the image.

## Future development
In the future I would like to add a comment box where users can add comments on the images posted. I would also like to add a text box so when the user uploads an image they can add a description of it.
